        <h2> Research Information </h2>
        <section>
            <p>This project is part of a research on telerobotic puppetry in <a href="https://aalto.fi/en">Aalto University</a>. We use technology creatively and playfully to engage in political discourse and bridge gaps between groups in conflict. We are guided by open participation and open source. We work with activist communities to create solutions, publish DIY instructions to the public, and invite anyone to join the activities</p>
            <p>Theatre has been used for centuries as a tool for political expression. In our work, we co-create puppets that can perform at a distance. Such telerobotic puppets ask questions on identity, borders, and the role of humor in political discourse</p>
            <p>While the installation takes an active role in the political conflict between Israel and Palestine, it does not take a stance on the conflict. Furthermore, the data and documentation gathered will not be used to suggest a certain political opinion. They will be used for academic research on human-computer interaction and intergroup communication that strives to be as objective and inclusive as possible.</p>
            <p>Event organizers may take public photos and videos of events. Those could be used for research analysis. <strong>After analysis, all identifying materials are deleted.</strong> The resulting data will consist of an anonymous record describing the interaction between the participants and the puppets and participant reactions to the installation. Those may later be published in an academic publication, including anonymous quotes. </p>
            <p>If you refuse to have your picture or video taken, please notify the organizers on site. Refer to the privacy notice for further information.</p>
            <p>The research is funded by the <a href="https://koneensaatio.fi/en">Kone Foundation.</a></p>
            <p>Questions regarding the conduct of the research study may be addressed to the person in charge of the study:<br>Avner Peled<br><a href="mailto:avner.peled@aalto.fi">avner.peled@aalto.fi</a></p>
