            <h3>1.	What is being studied in this research study and the purpose of processing personal data</h3>
            <p>In this research, we use technology creatively and playfully to engage in political discourse and bridge gaps between groups in conflict. We are guided by open participation and open source. We work with activist communities to create solutions, publish DIY instructions to the public, and invite anyone to join the activities. With technological puppets, we ask questions on identity, borders, and the role of humour in political discourse. After every activity, we ask ourselves what worked and what didn’t. We construct theories and guidelines to promote the cause of technology in service of humans. </p>
            <p>This research is funded by the Kone Foundation</p>
